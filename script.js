const reading_passage_1 = `<div><p>In some ways, Lenore's life can be mapped through her relationship with meat. She's a fisherman's daughter, and in her earlier years, she thought all reasonable adults owned boats of various sorts. In college, she worked a variety of non-glamorous food-industry jobs. As she learned more about how animals in the food system are treated (in part thanks to her well-informed vegan partner), she shifted her own diet towards the plant side of the spectrum. As her career took her into massive factory farms and slaughterhouses, her resolve deepened.</p> <p>Evan is a bit more on the fence. While he basically agrees with Lenore, his position is that animals play a vital role in recycling nutrients in well-managed farming systems, and raising animals is a source of livelihood for hundreds of millions of people (including many of the world's poor). He also respects the fact that consuming animals is intrinsic to many cultures, including Indigenous communities. Yet he completely agrees with Lenore that many of the ways animals are raised and slaughtered today are deeply problematic from both animal welfare and sustainability perspectives. So, while he still enjoys eating meat occasionally, he's pretty discriminating about where it comes from.</p> <p>With that said, the two of us have had a running disagreement around the role of meat in space. This tension emerged early in writing this book. Lenore opened the debate.</p> <p>'Evan, I'm wondering if we should even bother to look at meat? Advanced fermentation of dairy is one thing, but couldn't our Martians simply be vegetarians?” As she said this, she was staring out the window of her apartment in Vancouver where the crocuses were coming up and the dark of 2021 seemed to be receding.</p> <p> Meanwhile, in Ontario, winter was providing another unwelcome snowfall. 'Humor me; let's stick with the protein theme for the moment,' said Evan, glancing out at the accumulating inches of icy white. 'Are Martians going to eat steak produced locally? Seared tuna, wild-caught on Earth, and shipped up a space elevator in vacuum packs? I mean, we can't just have our community living on vats of algae.'</p> <p>Meanwhile, in Ontario, winter was providing another unwelcome snowfall.

Seared tuna, wild-caught on Earth, and shipped up a space elevator in vacuum packs? I mean, we can't just have our community living on vats of algae.'</p> <p>'But why would we take animal farming, which is horridly inefficient and ethically bankrupt, with us to a new planet? Let's try to figure out not only how BaseTown is going to get its protein but look at ways that can run on minimal inputs and still taste great.'</p> <p>'Fair,' Evan said. 'I'm all over being 'plant forward' in terms of diet, but I don't know if we'll be able to sell Mars if it's vegan. Most of the world is omnivorous... convincing would-be Martians to sign up for a months-long journey through the inky void will be hard enough, so I think we need to offer food that most people would consider to be halfway decent.'</p> <p>Lenore paused. 'Well, if we are making dairy without cows, maybe we just take that a step further. I know a guy from Seattle who may be able to help. And I do miss salmon…'</p> <p>Lenore and her partner, Katya, often make a day trip or weekend wander to Seattle. As a geographer and incorrigible traveler, whenever she passes the customs offices that separate the U.S. and Canada, Lenore marvels at the strange power of the imaginary line separating the two countries. After all, Seattle and Vancouver are both washed by the waters of the Salish Sea. The Salish peoples, who occupied the region for thousands of years, had their own boundaries and borders, and the sea itself was a combination highway and larder. The twisted topography of the Pacific Northwest doesn't lend itself to easy habitation, but the sea was a gift of open horizon, smooth passage, and oceanic bounty.</p> <p>Lenore's family sold fish in Seattle, tracing these ancient trade routes and traversing the modernized portage of shipping locks to Lake Union. Even all these millennia later, the sea is still a highway. Lenore and Katya's trips to Seattle follow a pattern. They stop at Trader Joe's to stock up on exotic foods (cookie butter and cauliflower gnocchi, anyone?). They poke around the shops on Capital Hill. And Lenore visits Pike Place Market, where she gathers truffle salt, hand-ground spices unknown to the spice-averse palates of many Canadians, and cocktail bitters. She also stops for a moment to watch the vendors throw salmon.</p> <p>It's something to behold. Brawny, bearded men bent double over massive, gutted fish displayed carefully on mounds of ice. They grasp the slippery salmon, and with a confident underhanded toss, throw the bodies twenty feet, over aisles, counters, and other consumers, to be caught by equally burly fishmongers who weigh and bag the fish. The assembled crowd cheers at the sight.</p> <p>The short explanation for this tourist ritual is that decades ago, fish stall owner John Yokoyama noticed that thanks to the market's vintage architecture, he had to take one hundred steps to move a fish from the back of his shop to the front counter. Noting the distance was shorter as the crow flies, he tossed a fish through the air at his assistant. The technique caught on, and now people from around the world come to watch.</p> <p>The longer explanation for Pike Market's fish tossing tells us something about food that we will need to know as we prepare for Mars. Seattle is a water place, a boundary place. Here, at the heart of the Salish Sea, people know and love the salmon. Salmon are a keystone species, cherished by tourists and locals alike. Yet despite this love (or because of it), the salmon are in decline—a combination of habitat loss, decades of overfishing, pollution, and climate change is pushing this species into danger. A group of innovators is working to save the salmon by developing new technologies that will allow us to satisfy our craving for salmon without depleting the ocean. From this, we can glimpse how we might bring protein to Mars.</p> <p>There is something magical about seafood. It is one of the few sectors of the food economy still connecting us to the hunter-gatherer lifestyle that dominated most of human history, where people actively consume food harvested wild. And it isn't a marginal activity; today, fish accounts for 17 percent of all animal protein devoured by humans, and about half of this still comes from the wild. Of course, this is changing, and farmed fishing is growing by leaps and bounds. Either wild or farmed, all this fish is a big business. Nearly sixty million people work in fisheries and aquaculture, 200 million jobs are directly or indirectly connected with harvesting fish, and about half of this trade comes from developing countries.</p> <p>All this activity takes a toll on wild stocks. Roughly two-thirds of the world's fisheries are either fished to their limit or overfished. But this isn't entirely a bad news story. A recent study led by University of Washington professor Ray Hilborn showed that in regions where fisheries are carefully managed, stocks are stable. In some cases, well-managed fisheries are improving. Careful, sustainable management has spread to over half of the Earth's fisheries. Fish species aren't out of the aquatic woods yet, but we've begun a transition from raw exploitation to stewarding complex ecological systems. These are the skills we will need to perfect if we are to survive in the much smaller ecosystems we will establish on Mars.</p> <p>The salmon faces particularly difficult challenges. There are five commercial species of salmon swimming in the waters of the Pacific Northwest: chinook (king), coho, chum, pink, and sockeye. The sockeye is known for its bright red flesh and delicate taste. Overfishing has been a problem for West Coast salmon at least since Europeans arrived. They command high prices at the dock, and demand is always strong.</p> <p>Salmon face another problem. They are anadromous, meaning the fish are born in freshwater, migrate to the ocean to live their lives, and then return to their home rivers to spawn and die four years later. Near the locks leading to Lake Union in Seattle, the Ballard Fish Ladder provides a shortcut for the salmon, allowing them a quick route out from the Pacific and into their freshwater spawning grounds. Watching the fish leap up the ladder, moving from pool to pool, is almost as popular for Emerald City citizens as watching the Pike Market fishmongers toss their less fortunate cousins.</p> <p>The salmon's migratory pattern makes them vulnerable to human activity. In the ocean, they face overfishing, pollution, and climate challenges. Inland, they require healthy rivers full of quiet wetlands, meandering tributaries, undisturbed gravel, and cool clean water. Human habitation doesn't mix well with pristine rivers. From housing subdivisions disturbing local streams to hydroelectric dams altering habitats, West Coast salmon runs are now about 5 percent of their historical maximums. Climate change worsens the situation, with unpredictable floods and droughts. Today, about half of the salmon consumed on the West Coast is farmed in giant net pens suspended in the ocean. However, raising Atlantic salmon in these pens spreads diseases like sea lice to their wild West Coast cousins.</p> <p>It is hard to imagine the West Coast without its iconic fish. Indigenous groups of the Salish Sea harvested salmon intensively because of their anadromous nature. Communities built settlements near rivers, letting the abundant fish come to them each fall. Salmon was stored, smoked, dried, fermented, or turned into pemmican, which was traded far inland. Today, salmon remains central to West Coast cuisine, from sushi to the BC roll. The fishery generates $1.2 billion in GDP on the U.S. side and supports 17,000 jobs.</p> <p>'Yes, but...' Evan interrupted Lenore's trip down Salmon Lane. 'What does all this have to do with a book about food on Mars?'</p> <p>Lenore replied, 'If this tasty bounty is to continue, the fishery must be stabilized at a sustainable level. But where, then, can we source more salmon? After all, demand is rising everywhere. I think new technologies may make it possible to enjoy salmon without impacting the fish themselves. Just before the pandemic, I talked with Justin Kolbeck and Aryé Elfenbein, who founded a company called Wildtype. They use cellular agriculture to create salmon by farming fish cells. Unfortunately, the stupid pandemic means I've not yet been able to taste their product, but if you check out their web page, the product looks perfect!'</p> <p>Evan pulled up their web page and nodded. The fish looked mouth-wateringly good, just the way sashimi should.</p> <p>'Is that a trick?' he asked. 'I mean, that looks just like the real thing.'</p> <p>'Apparently, it's legit. This is all cell-grown protein and fat. It's supposed to taste great and is free of microplastics, mercury, or, of course, fish slaughter. Wildtype is even opening a tasting room in San Francisco.'</p> <p>The two of them slid into daydreaming about traveling down to taste the final product.</p></div>`
